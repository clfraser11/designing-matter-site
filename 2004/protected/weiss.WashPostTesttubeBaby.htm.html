<H1 align=center>Test-Tube Baby Born To Save Ill Sister; Genetic Selection By 
Colorado Parents May Herald Era</H1>

<P>A Colorado couple used genetic tests to create a test tube baby that would 
have the exact type of cells desperately needed to save their 6-year-old 
daughter, doctors said yesterday.
<P>The case represents the first time a couple is known to have screened their 
embryos before implanting one in the mother's womb for the purpose of saving the 
life of a sibling.
<P>The test tube baby, named Adam, was born in Denver on Aug. 29. Doctors 
collected cells from his umbilical cord, a painless procedure, and on Sept. 26 
infused them into his sister Molly's circulatory system. The girl is 
recuperating in a Minneapolis hospital, and within about a week doctors should 
know whether the procedure was successful.
<P>Whether or not the transplant works, doctors and ethicists said, the 
procedure is both a promising and worrisome harbinger of where scientific 
advances are taking human reproduction in the near future--at least for those 
who can afford to take that path.
<P>On the one hand, experts said, that future will be one in which the power of 
genetics and embryo cell research will lead to novel therapies for incurable 
diseases. In this case the girl suffered from an inherited bone marrow 
deficiency that is universally fatal without a transplant like the one she got 
from her newborn brother.
<P>"We knew we were running out of time," said Charles Strom, director of 
medical genetics at Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where the genetic testing 
was done. Now, he said, the girl has an 85 percent to 90 percent chance of being 
largely free of the marrow disease.
<P>On the other hand, the new work also points to a future in which parents will 
have unprecedented options to choose the traits of their children, for whatever 
practical or capricious reason they may have.
<P>"You could say it's quickly becoming like buying a new car, where you decide 
which package of accessories you want," said Jeffrey Kahn, director of the 
University of Minnesota's Center for Bioethics. "I suspect that it's only 
because we don't yet have the tests that we're not having parents asking for 
embryos without a predisposition to homosexuality or for kids who will grow to 
more than 6 feet tall."
<P>The girl who received the cell transplant, Molly Nash of Englewood, Colo., 
was born with Fanconi anemia, an inherited disorder that causes a massive 
failure of bone marrow cell production. Children with the disease suffer from 
anemia, bleeding disorders and severe immune system problems and generally die 
from leukemia or other complications by age 7. The only effective treatment is 
to get a batch of healthy cells from a perfectly matched sibling to replace the 
ailing child's faulty bone marrow cells.
<P>Molly's parents, Lisa and Jack Nash, had long wanted additional children, but 
were afraid to conceive another for fear that it, too, would be affected by the 
disease. Each parent carries both a normal and a faulty version of the Fanconi 
gene, which meant they had a 25 percent chance of having an affected child with 
each pregnancy.
<P>But a few years ago they learned of a new technique under development called 
preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Researchers harmlessly pluck a single cell 
from embryos that have been created by standard in vitro fertilization and are 
developing in a laboratory dish. They test each of those cells for the presence 
of a disease gene, and then transfer to a woman's uterus only those embryos 
whose cells test normal.
<P>Lisa Nash said that when she tried in vitro fertilization for the first time 
a few years ago she turned to preimplantation genetic diagnosis primarily to 
select an embryo unaffected by Fanconi. She allowed researchers to test the 
embryos for compatibility with Molly's cells, but the tests were not very good 
then, she said.
<P>The couple went through this four times, and each time benefited from 
increasingly sophisticated cell typing tests. But none of the attempts resulted 
in a pregnancy. Finally, in the fertility cycle initiated late last year, two of 
the couple's 15 embryos tested as both free of the disease and having a perfect 
match for Molly, Strom said.
<P>Only one of those two embryos was healthy enough to transfer to Lisa's womb. 
On Christmas Eve the couple learned that the embryo had implanted properly and 
that Lisa was pregnant.
<P>After Adam was born, doctors saved the blood cells from his umbilical cord. 
Research has shown that umbilical cord cells, like transplanted bone marrow 
cells, can travel to a recipient's bone marrow and repopulate the marrow space 
with healthy cells.
<P>The transplant was performed last week at Fairview-University Hospital in 
Minneapolis, which specializes in bone marrow replacements for children with 
Fanconi anemia.
<P>"Molly was holding Adam in her lap," Lisa Nash said, while the cells dripped 
through a plastic tube into the girl's chest. "It was the most awesome, 
monumental experience of our life, yet it was so simple. You'd think there'd be 
thunderbolts and lightning, but it was calm."
<P>So far, doctors said, Molly is doing well.
<P>"Molly's having no complications whatsoever. She's up and playing on the 
computer in her room," said University of Minnesota cord blood specialist John 
Wagner, who oversaw the transplant. Soon, he said, she will be out of the 
high-risk period that follows such procedures. Doctors suppressed her immune 
system with the radiation and chemotherapy to increase the chances the cells 
would not be rejected.
<P>The Nash case is reminiscent of one in which a California man, Abe Ayala, had 
his vasectomy reversed in 1989, 17 years after the birth of his second and what 
he thought would be his last child. Ayala took the step so that he and his wife 
Mary could have a third child--one who might serve as a bone marrow donor for 
their ailing daughter Anissa.
<P>At 16, Anissa had been diagnosed with a deadly form of leukemia, and the only 
possible cure was a cell transplant from a perfectly matched donor, none of 
which could be found. The Ayalas knew that they had one-in-four odds of having a 
child whose cells matched Anissa's and they took that chance. Luck was with 
them. Newborn sister Marissa inherited all the right genes from her parents, and 
the cells she provided saved her sister's life.
<P>The new case differs in that luck was not a factor. That's a difference that 
some find reassuring, as it eliminates the chance a newborn will disappoint 
parents who had wished for a certain cell type. But some find that troublesome 
because it moves a step closer to "designer babies."
<P>Both cases raise questions about whether there are "good" or "bad" reasons to 
have children--a concern that Strom was quick to dismiss.
<P>"People have kids for all kinds of reasons: to save a failing marriage, to 
work on the family farm, to perpetuate the family name. In the scheme of things, 
this is the most wanted child I've ever met. They love the heck out of this 
kid."
