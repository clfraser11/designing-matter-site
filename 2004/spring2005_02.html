							          <h1>What to Expect in Designing Matter 2005</h1>
							          
							          <p>For Spring 2005, we maintain many of the strengths of the program from DM04 — fascinating session topics, 
							          engaging speakers, and an invested teaching team consisting of award winning faculty, graduate teaching 
							          assistants (GTAs) and undergraduate project consultants (UPCs).  </p>
							          
							          <p>Most UVA speakers from last year are 
							          returning and popular sessions on stem cells, organ transplantation, computer graphics, architecture, 
							          environmental footprint and policy, and astronomy sessions are maintained for Spring 2005.   
							          (See the session links from last year.)  Exciting new sessions and topics include the following.  
							          This year we will once again begin with the very small, exploring the atomic perspective with Prof. 
							          Bob Jones from Physics.  Moving up in size, Prof. Claire Cronmiller from Biology and Prof. James Childress 
							          from Bioethics will lead a session on the science and ethics of gene therapy.  At the human scale, 
							          this year we will hear from developmental psychologist Prof. Angeline Lillard about how interactions 
							          with matter affect learning, as appreciated by recent advances in psychology and Montessori education.  
							          An invitation is also extended to Prof. Judy Deloache, also from the Psychology Department, whose work 
							          addresses questions of how children interact with matter, and come to understand and negotiate objects 
							          in the world around them.</p>   
							          
							          <p>Later in the semester, Dean Dass, an artist and professor in the Art Department, 
							          and Lisa Russ Spaar, a poet, professor, and Director of the Creative Writing program at UVA will consider 
							          creative approaches to the design of matter with printed images and words as media.  Currently they and 
							          their students collaborate in a program called Matrix Redux.  </p>
							          
							          <p>Returning teaching assistants include graduate students Ray Malewitz and Mike Dunn, and Laura Juliano, an undergraduate project consultant 
							          who will coordinate the new proposal workshop component of the course.  They are joined by new graduate 
							          TAs, Stephanie Held from Population Biology and Elizabeth Eklund from Environmental Sciences and Policy.  
							          New UPCs include Ellen McRae, Elizabeth Dyer, Christine Wnek and Ben Schlabs.  
							          (Elizabeth, Christine and Ben were students in DM04 who are now joining the teaching team this year, 
							          eager to share what they learned from the experience.)</p>
										
		          
							          <h3>Designing Matter is a learning experiment that continues to evolve. </h3>
							          
							          <p>Student feedback really matters.  In response to students' suggestions, we plan improved assignments and other enhancements this year.  Specifically, weekly questions and reflections replace weekly lab notebook assignments. Popular discussion sections (yes, popular!) will be reserved for debating session themes and ideas; whereas, support for planning projects and writing proposals will now be addressed in special, supplementary workshops offered throughout the course of the semester.  The Designing Matter grant competition will be maintained for Spring 2005. Yes, it is true that you can actually win grant support for an outstanding project idea and proposal!  See "Exhibit" and "Projects" links to check out the award winning projects from last year.  For this reason, Designing Matter is an excellent choice for students who are eager to identify and explore project ideas for their distinguished majors theses, for independent and collaborative research, and those who plan to submit proposals for UVA and external research award competitions.  
							          Students select their own project ideas on matter-related themes, exploring new areas or themes that are complementary 
							          to their ongoing research and other course work.</p>
										 <p>We welcome students from all disciplines and other members of the university and local community too, to this open forum.  It is our belief that many of the most interesting questions and pressing challenges that we face are too big for individual persons and disciplines to tackle alone.  We must come together to share our insights, both common and differing perspectives, and pool our talents if we are to gain a deeper understanding and to address in a meaningful way, the large issues impacting local, national and global society.  Designing Matter is a place for us to experiment with new approaches to learning and problem solving, where we are encouraged to seek connections and to think big.</p>
